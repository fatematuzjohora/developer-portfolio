            <h3>Get busy living or get busy dying.</h3>
            <p>Every living person is both living and dying every day.

                Every living person can either move their life in a positive direction (“get busy living”) or not (“get
                busy dying”). That choice makes all the difference. Unfortunately dying is the default. Living takes
                effort. In prison, it must take supreme effort, since there is so much working against you.</p>
